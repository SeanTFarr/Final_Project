# Final_Project
Goal: Use Machine Learning to predict future crimes in certain cities/locations.
  
    NOTE: I think we should pull data from a collection of sources, either focused on the same city or on a collection of cities in a certain area.

## Prospective Datasets
City of Gainesville - https://data.cityofgainesville.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Responses/gvua-xt9q
City of Chicago - https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2
City of Chicago - https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime
Chicago Census data - https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/chicagocityillinois

## Outline of Project with tools

1. Data collection via either CSV file or JSON format.
2. Data cleaning using Pandas
3. Database creation using SQL
4. Machine Learning model using Python/Jupyter Notebook/Sci-kit Learn
5. Visualize ML output using Tableau or JavaScript
